**CatDB Generated Pipeline Examples:**

This directory contains a list of example pipelines generated by `CatDB` and `AIDE` baseline using the `Gemini-2.5-pro` model. During generation, we anonymized dataset names and features for some datasets. The datasets themselves are available in the `Experiments/data` directory. In the original paper, we reported pipeline performance based on `Gemini-1.5-pro`, so some results here may differ.

The structure of the content in each subdirectory is as follows (We set the number of iterations to `5`, which means we will generate `5` pipelines per dataset):

```bash
.
└── dataset_name
    ├── CatDB.prompt -- content of submitted prompt
    ├── iteration-1-RUN.py -- pipeline version 1
    ├── ....
    └── iteration-5-RUN.py -- pipeline version 5
```

The `pipeline-performance.csv` file reports the pipelines generated by CatDB. It includes various evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC-OVR, AUC-OVO, F1-score, R2, etc.) for both the train and test datasets. We also report the elapsed time for catalog loading, pipeline generation, and execution. Finally, the file contains the number of tokens consumed for each individual dataset and iteration.
