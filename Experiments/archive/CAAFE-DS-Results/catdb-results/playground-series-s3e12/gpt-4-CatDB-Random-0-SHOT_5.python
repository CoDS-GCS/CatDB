The error message indicates that the file '/correct/path/to/train_data.csv' does not exist. The user needs to replace '/correct/path/to/train_data.csv' and '/correct/path/to/test_data.csv' with the correct paths to the data files. However, without knowing the correct paths, I can't fix this error. The rest of the code seems fine.
