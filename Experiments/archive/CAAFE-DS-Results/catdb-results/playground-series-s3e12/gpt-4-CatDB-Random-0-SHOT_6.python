The provided code doesn't seem to be a pipeline code, it's more of a comment or explanation. The error message indicates an unterminated string literal, which usually means a string is not properly closed with a matching quote. However, without the actual pipeline code, it's impossible to provide a fix. Please provide the actual pipeline code.
