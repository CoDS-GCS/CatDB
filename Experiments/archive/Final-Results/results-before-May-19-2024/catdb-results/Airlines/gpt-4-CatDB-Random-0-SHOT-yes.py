# ```end

# ```python
# Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
# As per the given schema and data profiling info, there is no missing data or outliers. So, no data cleaning is required.
# ```end

# ```python
# Perform feature processing
# Select an appropriate scaler for the numerical columns
# Encode categorical values by "on-hot-encoder" for the following columns
# Encode all "object" columns by dummyEncode

# Define preprocessor
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[

target = 'Delay'

# Perform drops columns, if these may be redundant and hurt the predictive performance of the downstream classifier
# No columns are dropped as all the columns are necessary for the prediction of 'Delay'

# ```python
# Choose the suitable machine learning algorithm or technique (classifier)
# RandomForestClassifier is chosen because it is a versatile and widely used algorithm that can handle both categorical and numerical features.

# Define classifier
