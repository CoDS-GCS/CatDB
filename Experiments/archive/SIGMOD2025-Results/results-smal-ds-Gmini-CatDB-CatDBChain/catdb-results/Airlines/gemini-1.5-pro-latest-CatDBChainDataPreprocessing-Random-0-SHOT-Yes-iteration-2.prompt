SYSTEM MESSAGE:
###  Task: Generate list of tasks are required for data preprocessing in Python 3.10.
###  Input: A dataset in CSV format, a schema that describes the columns and data types of the dataset, and a data profiling info that summarizes the statistics and quality of the dataset.
###  Output: A Python 3.10 code that performs the following steps:
#1 : Import the necessary libraries and modules.
#2 : Load the training and test datasets. For the training data, utilize the variable """train_data=../../../data/Airlines/Airlines_train.csv""", and for the test data, employ the variable """test_data=../../../data/Airlines/Airlines_test.csv""". Utilize pandas' CSV readers to load the datasets.
#3 : Don't split the train_data into train and test sets. Use only the given datasets.
#4 : The user will provide the Schema, and Data Profiling Info of the dataset with columns appropriately named as attributes, enclosed in triple quotes, and preceded by the prefix "Schema, and Data Profiling Info:".
#5 : If the question is not relevant to the dataset or the task, the output should be: "Insufficient information."
#6 : Utilize data augmentation techniques on the dataset to enhance accuracy and mitigate overfitting.
#7 : The target feature in the dataset is "Delay".
#8 : Don't display the first few rows of the datasets.
#9 : Each codeblock ends with "```end" and starts with "```python".
#10 : Don't use "if __name__ == '__main__':" style, use only flat mode.

PROMPT TEXT:
###  Description of the dataset:

Airlines Dataset Inspired in the regression dataset from Elena Ikonomovska. The task is to predict whether a given flight will be delayed, given the information of the scheduled departure.


### Schema, and Data Profiling Info:
"""
# DayOfWeek (int), categorical-values [2,3,0,6,5,4,1]
# AirportTo (int), distinct-count [190], min-value [0.0], max-value [284.0], median-value [25.0], mean-value [43.102]
# Airline (int), categorical-values [0,2,14,7,5,17,4,15,11,1,10,12,13,16,3,9,8,6]
# AirportFrom (int), distinct-count [187], min-value [0.0], max-value [282.0], median-value [65.0], mean-value [76.21]
# Flight (int), distinct-count [1611], min-value [1.0], max-value [7801.0], median-value [1859.5], mean-value [2457.833]
# Length (int), distinct-count [288], min-value [26.0], max-value [420.0], median-value [116.0], mean-value [131.197]
# Time (int), distinct-count [520], min-value [15.0], max-value [1431.0], median-value [786.0], mean-value [795.0555]
# Delay (bool, **This is a target column**), categorical-values [1,0]
"""

### Encode categorical values by "on-hot-encoder" for the following columns:
	# Columns: DayOfWeek,Airline,Delay

### Dataset Attribute:
# Number of samples (rows) in training dataset: 2000

### Question: Provide a pipeline code that do data preprocessing in a multi-threaded environment.
