SYSTEM MESSAGE:
###  Task: Select an appropriate classifier Machine Learning model for the question.
###  Input: first draft version of pipline with a Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering task enclosed in "<CODE> pipline code will be here. </CODE>", and a schema that describes the columns and data types of the dataset, and a data profiling info that summarizes the statistics and quality of the dataset.
###  Output: A modified Python 3.10 code with a Machine Learning algorithm task that performs the following steps:
#1 : Select classifier algorithm (such as RandomForestClassifier/XGBoost and so on) predicting "Delay".
#2 : Select a suitable hyperparameters for the selected algorithm. If the algorithm is RandomForestClassifier then pass max_leaf_nodes=500 as parameter.
#3 : Code formatting for binary classification evaluation:
```python
# Report evaluation based on train and test dataset
# Calculate the model accuracy, represented by a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates low accuracy and 1 signifies higher accuracy. Store the accuracy value in a variable labeled as "Train_Accuracy=..." and "Test_Accuracy=...".
# Calculate the model f1 score, represented by a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates low accuracy and 1 signifies higher accuracy. Store the f1 score value in a variable labeled as "Train_F1_score=..." and "Test_F1_score=...".
# Calculate AUC (Area Under the Curve), represented by a value between 0 and 1.
# Print the train AUC result: print(f"Train_AUC:{Train_AUC}")
# Print the train accuracy result: print(f"Train_Accuracy:{Train_Accuracy}")   
# Print the train f1 score result: print(f"Train_F1_score:{Train_F1_score}")
# Print the test AUC result: print(f"Test_AUC:{Test_AUC}")
# Print the test accuracy result: print(f"Test_Accuracy:{Test_Accuracy}")   
# Print the test f1 score result: print(f"Test_F1_score:{Test_F1_score}") 
```end

#4 : Don't report validation evaluation. We don't need it.
#5 : Each codeblock ends with "```end" and starts with "```python".
#6 : Don't use "if __name__ == '__main__':" style, use only flat mode.

PROMPT TEXT:
###  Description of the dataset:

Airlines Dataset Inspired in the regression dataset from Elena Ikonomovska. The task is to predict whether a given flight will be delayed, given the information of the scheduled departure.


### <CODE>
# ```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
import multiprocessing

train_data = pd.read_csv("../../../data/Airlines/Airlines_train.csv")
test_data = pd.read_csv("../../../data/Airlines/Airlines_test.csv")

categorical_features = ["DayOfWeek", "Airline"]

preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ("onehot", OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown="ignore"), categorical_features),
    ],
    remainder="passthrough",  # Keep the remaining columns
)

pipeline = Pipeline(
    steps=[
        ("preprocessor", preprocessor),
    ]
)

n_threads = multiprocessing.cpu_count()

train_data_processed = pipeline.fit_transform(train_data)

test_data_processed = pipeline.transform(test_data)
# ```end
</CODE>

### Schema, and Data Profiling Info:
"""
# DayOfWeek (int), categorical-values [2,3,0,6,5,4,1]
# AirportTo (int), distinct-count [190]
# Airline (int), categorical-values [0,2,14,7,5,17,4,15,11,1,10,12,13,16,3,9,8,6]
# AirportFrom (int), distinct-count [187]
# Flight (int), distinct-count [1611]
# Length (int), distinct-count [288]
# Time (int), distinct-count [520]
# Delay (bool, **This is a target column**), categorical-values [1,0]
"""

### Encode categorical values by "on-hot-encoder" for the following columns:
	# Columns: DayOfWeek,Airline,Delay

### Dataset Attribute:
# Number of samples (rows) in training dataset: 2000

### Question: Provide a complete pipeline code that can be executed in a multi-threaded environment.
