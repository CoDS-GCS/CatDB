SYSTEM MESSAGE:
###  Task: Select an appropriate classifier Machine Learning model for the question.
###  Input: first draft version of pipline with a Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering task enclosed in "<CODE> pipline code will be here. </CODE>", and a schema that describes the columns and data types of the dataset, and a data profiling info that summarizes the statistics and quality of the dataset.
###  Output: A modified Python 3.10 code with a Machine Learning algorithm task that performs the following steps:
#1 : Select classifier algorithm (such as RandomForestClassifier/XGBoost and so on) predicting "class".
#2 : Select a suitable hyperparameters for the selected algorithm. If the algorithm is RandomForestClassifier then pass max_leaf_nodes=500 as parameter.
#3 : Code formatting for multiclass classification evaluation:
```python
# Report evaluation based on train and test dataset
# Calculate the model accuracy, represented by a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates low accuracy and 1 signifies higher accuracy. Store the accuracy value in a variable labeled as "Train_Accuracy=..." and "Test_Accuracy=...".
# Calculate the model log loss, a lower log-loss value means better predictions. Store the  log loss value in a variable labeled as "Train_Log_loss=..." and "Test_Log_loss=...".
# Calculate AUC_OVO (Area Under the Curve One-vs-One), represented by a value between 0 and 1.
# Calculate AUC_OVR (Area Under the Curve One-vs-Rest), represented by a value between 0 and 1.
# Print the train AUC One-vs-One result: print(f"Train_AUC_OVO:{Train_AUC_OVO}")
# Print the train AUC One-vs-Rest result: print(f"Train_AUC_OVR:{Train_AUC_OVR}")
# Print the train accuracy result: print(f"Train_Accuracy:{Train_Accuracy}")   
# Print the train log loss result: print(f"Train_Log_loss:{Train_Log_loss}") 
# Print the test AUC One-vs-One result: print(f"Test_AUC_OVO:{Test_AUC_OVO}")
# Print the test AUC One-vs-Rest result: print(f"Test_AUC_OVR:{Test_AUC_OVR}")
# Print the test accuracy result: print(f"Test_Accuracy:{Test_Accuracy}")   
# Print the test log loss result: print(f"Test_Log_loss:{Test_Log_loss}")
```end

#4 : Don't report validation evaluation. We don't need it.
#5 : Each codeblock ends with "```end" and starts with "```python".
#6 : Don't use "if __name__ == '__main__':" style, use only flat mode.

PROMPT TEXT:
###  Description of the dataset:

**Balance Scale Weight & Distance Database**  
This data set was generated to model psychological experimental results.  Each example is classified as having the balance scale tip to the right, tip to the left, or be balanced. The attributes are the left weight, the left distance, the right weight, and the right distance. The correct way to find the class is the greater of (left-distance * left-weight) and (right-distance * right-weight). If they are equal, it is balanced.



 Attribute description  
The attributes are the left weight, the left distance, the right weight, and the right distance.
