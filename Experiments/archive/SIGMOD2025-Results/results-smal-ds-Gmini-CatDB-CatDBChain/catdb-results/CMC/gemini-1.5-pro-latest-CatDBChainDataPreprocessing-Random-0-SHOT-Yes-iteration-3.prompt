SYSTEM MESSAGE:
###  Task: Generate list of tasks are required for data preprocessing in Python 3.10.
###  Input: A dataset in CSV format, a schema that describes the columns and data types of the dataset, and a data profiling info that summarizes the statistics and quality of the dataset.
###  Output: A Python 3.10 code that performs the following steps:
#1 : Import the necessary libraries and modules.
#2 : Load the training and test datasets. For the training data, utilize the variable """train_data=../../../data/CMC/CMC_train.csv""", and for the test data, employ the variable """test_data=../../../data/CMC/CMC_test.csv""". Utilize pandas' CSV readers to load the datasets.
#3 : Don't split the train_data into train and test sets. Use only the given datasets.
#4 : The user will provide the Schema, and Data Profiling Info of the dataset with columns appropriately named as attributes, enclosed in triple quotes, and preceded by the prefix "Schema, and Data Profiling Info:".
#5 : If the question is not relevant to the dataset or the task, the output should be: "Insufficient information."
#6 : Utilize data augmentation techniques on the dataset to enhance accuracy and mitigate overfitting.
#7 : The target feature in the dataset is "Contraceptive_method_used".
#8 : Don't display the first few rows of the datasets.
#9 : Each codeblock ends with "```end" and starts with "```python".
#10 : Don't use "if __name__ == '__main__':" style, use only flat mode.

###  Description of the dataset:

1. Title: Contraceptive Method Choice
 
    (a) Origin:  This dataset is a subset of the 1987 National Indonesia
                 Contraceptive Prevalence Survey
    (b) Creator: Tjen-Sien Lim (limt@stat.wisc.edu)
    (c) Donor:   Tjen-Sien Lim (limt@stat.wisc.edu)
    (c) Date:    June 7, 1997

 4. Relevant Information:
    This dataset is a subset of the 1987 National Indonesia Contraceptive
    Prevalence Survey. The samples are married women who were either not 
    pregnant or do not know if they were at the time of interview. The 
    problem is to predict the current contraceptive method choice 
    (no use, long-term methods, or short-term methods) of a woman based 
    on her demographic and socio-economic characteristics.
