SYSTEM MESSAGE:
###  Task: Generate list of tasks are required for data preprocessing in Python 3.10.
###  Input: A dataset in CSV format, a schema that describes the columns and data types of the dataset, and a data profiling info that summarizes the statistics and quality of the dataset.
###  Output: A Python 3.10 code that performs the following steps:
#1 : Import the necessary libraries and modules.
#2 : Load the training and test datasets. For the training data, utilize the variable """train_data=../../../data/Credit-g/Credit-g_train.csv""", and for the test data, employ the variable """test_data=../../../data/Credit-g/Credit-g_test.csv""". Utilize pandas' CSV readers to load the datasets.
#3 : Don't split the train_data into train and test sets. Use only the given datasets.
#4 : The user will provide the Schema, and Data Profiling Info of the dataset with columns appropriately named as attributes, enclosed in triple quotes, and preceded by the prefix "Schema, and Data Profiling Info:".
#5 : If the question is not relevant to the dataset or the task, the output should be: "Insufficient information."
#6 : Utilize data augmentation techniques on the dataset to enhance accuracy and mitigate overfitting.
#7 : The target feature in the dataset is "class".
#8 : Don't display the first few rows of the datasets.
#9 : Each codeblock ends with "```end" and starts with "```python".
#10 : Don't use "if __name__ == '__main__':" style, use only flat mode.

PROMPT TEXT:
###  Description of the dataset:

**German Credit dataset**  
This dataset classifies people described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks.

This dataset comes with a cost matrix: 
``` 
Good  Bad (predicted)  
Good   0    1   (actual)  
Bad    5    0  
```

It is worse to class a customer as good when they are bad (5), than it is to class a customer as bad when they are good (1).  



 Attribute description  

1. Status of existing checking account, in Deutsche Mark.  
2. Duration in months  
3. Credit history (credits taken, paid back duly, delays, critical accounts)  
4. Purpose of the credit (car, television,...)  
5. Credit amount  
6. Status of savings account/bonds, in Deutsche Mark.  
7. Present employment, in number of years.  
8. Installment rate in percentage of disposable income  
9. Personal status (married, single,...) and sex  
10. Other debtors / guarantors  
11. Present residence since X years  
12. Property (e.g. real estate)  
13. Age in years  
14. Other installment plans (banks, stores)  
15. Housing (rent, own,...)  
16. Number of existing credits at this bank  
17. Job  
18. Number of people being liable to provide maintenance for  
19. Telephone (yes,no)  
20. Foreign worker (yes,no)

	# Columns: residence_since,savings_status,job,purpose,property_magnitude,personal_status,num_dependents,existing_credits,employment,other_payment_plans,housing,duration,checking_status,installment_commitment,credit_history,other_parties,foreign_worker,own_telephone,class

### Dataset Attribute:
# Number of samples (rows) in training dataset: 1000

### Question: Provide a pipeline code that do data preprocessing in a multi-threaded environment.
