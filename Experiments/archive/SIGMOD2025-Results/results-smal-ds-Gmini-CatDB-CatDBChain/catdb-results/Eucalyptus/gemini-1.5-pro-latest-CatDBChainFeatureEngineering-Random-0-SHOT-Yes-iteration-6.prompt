SYSTEM MESSAGE:
###  Task: Select the appropriate features and target variables for the question (Feature Engineering Task). Additional columns add new semantic information, additional columns that are useful for a downstream algorithmpredicting "Utility". They can e.g. be feature combinations, transformations, aggregations where the new column is a function of the existing columns. Use appropriate scale factor for columns are needto transfer.
###  Input: first draft version of pipline with a Data Preprocessing task enclosed in "<CODE> pipline code will be here. </CODE>", and a schema that describes the columns and data types of the dataset, and a data profiling info that summarizes the statistics and quality of the dataset.
###  Output: A modified Python 3.10 code with additional feature enginnering tasks that performs the following steps:
#1 : The target feature in the dataset is "Utility".
#2 : Perform drops columns, if these may be redundant and hurt the predictive performance of the downstream classifier (Feature selection). Dropping columns may help as the chance of overfitting is lower, especially if the dataset is small. The Utility will be trained on the dataset with the generated columns and evaluated on a holdout set.
#3 : If the question is not relevant to the dataset or the task, the output should be: "Insufficient information."
#4 : Don't display the first few rows of the datasets.
#5 : Each codeblock ends with "```end" and starts with "```python".
#6 : Don't use "if __name__ == '__main__':" style, use only flat mode.

PROMPT TEXT:
###  Description of the dataset:

**Eucalyptus Soil Conservation**  
The objective was to determine which seedlots in a species are best for soil conservation in seasonally dry hill country. Determination is found by measurement of height, diameter by height, survival, and other contributing factors. 
 
It is important to note that eucalypt trial methods changed over time; earlier trials included mostly 15 - 30cm tall seedling grown in peat plots and the later trials have included mostly three replications of eight trees grown. This change may contribute to less significant results.

Experimental data recording procedures which require noting include:
 - instances with no data recorded due to experimental recording procedures
   require that the absence of a species from one replicate at a site was
   treated as a missing value, but if absent from two or more replicates at a
   site the species was excluded from the site's analyses.
 - missing data for survival, vigour, insect resistance, stem form, crown form
   and utility especially for the data recorded at the Morea Station; this 
   could indicate the death of species in these areas or a lack in collection
   of data.
