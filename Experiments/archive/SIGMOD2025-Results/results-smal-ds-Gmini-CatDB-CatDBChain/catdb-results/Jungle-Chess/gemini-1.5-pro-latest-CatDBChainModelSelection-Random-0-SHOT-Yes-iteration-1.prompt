SYSTEM MESSAGE:
###  Task: Select an appropriate classifier Machine Learning model for the question.
###  Input: first draft version of pipline with a Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering task enclosed in "<CODE> pipline code will be here. </CODE>", and a schema that describes the columns and data types of the dataset, and a data profiling info that summarizes the statistics and quality of the dataset.
###  Output: A modified Python 3.10 code with a Machine Learning algorithm task that performs the following steps:
#1 : Select classifier algorithm (such as RandomForestClassifier/XGBoost and so on) predicting "class".
#2 : Select a suitable hyperparameters for the selected algorithm. If the algorithm is RandomForestClassifier then pass max_leaf_nodes=500 as parameter.
#3 : Code formatting for multiclass classification evaluation:
```python
# Report evaluation based on train and test dataset
# Calculate the model accuracy, represented by a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates low accuracy and 1 signifies higher accuracy. Store the accuracy value in a variable labeled as "Train_Accuracy=..." and "Test_Accuracy=...".
# Calculate the model log loss, a lower log-loss value means better predictions. Store the  log loss value in a variable labeled as "Train_Log_loss=..." and "Test_Log_loss=...".
# Calculate AUC_OVO (Area Under the Curve One-vs-One), represented by a value between 0 and 1.
# Calculate AUC_OVR (Area Under the Curve One-vs-Rest), represented by a value between 0 and 1.
# Print the train AUC One-vs-One result: print(f"Train_AUC_OVO:{Train_AUC_OVO}")
# Print the train AUC One-vs-Rest result: print(f"Train_AUC_OVR:{Train_AUC_OVR}")
# Print the train accuracy result: print(f"Train_Accuracy:{Train_Accuracy}")   
# Print the train log loss result: print(f"Train_Log_loss:{Train_Log_loss}") 
# Print the test AUC One-vs-One result: print(f"Test_AUC_OVO:{Test_AUC_OVO}")
# Print the test AUC One-vs-Rest result: print(f"Test_AUC_OVR:{Test_AUC_OVR}")
# Print the test accuracy result: print(f"Test_Accuracy:{Test_Accuracy}")   
# Print the test log loss result: print(f"Test_Log_loss:{Test_Log_loss}")
```end

#4 : Don't report validation evaluation. We don't need it.
#5 : Each codeblock ends with "```end" and starts with "```python".
#6 : Don't use "if __name__ == '__main__':" style, use only flat mode.

PROMPT TEXT:
###  Description of the dataset:


 Description 



This dataset is part of a collection datasets based on the game "Jungle Chess" (a.k.a. Dou Shou Qi). For a description of the rules, please refer to the paper (link attached). The paper also contains a description of various constructed features. As the tablebases are a disjoint set of several tablebases based on which (two) pieces are on the board, we have uploaded all tablebases that have explicit different content:

* Rat vs Rat
* Rat vs Panther
* Rat vs. Lion
* Rat vs. Elephant
* Panther vs. Lion
* Panther vs. Elephant
* Tiger vs. Lion
* Lion vs. Lion
* Lion vs. Elephant
* Elephant vs. Elephant
* Complete (Combination of the above)
* RAW Complete (Combination of the above, containing for both pieces just the rank, file and strength information). This dataset contains a similar classification problem as, e.g., the King and Rook vs. King problem and is suitable for classification tasks. 

(Note that this dataset is one of the above mentioned datasets). Additionally, note that several subproblems are very similar. Having seen a given positions from one of the tablebases arguably gives a lot of information about the outcome of the same position in the other tablebases.
