# ```python
# Import all required packages
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score
# ```end

# ```python
# Load the training and test datasets
train_data = pd.read_csv('../../../data/dataset_1_rnc/dataset_1_rnc_train.csv')

# Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
# Here we assume that the data is already clean and does not contain any missing or incorrect values.
# If this is not the case, appropriate data cleaning steps should be added here.
# ```end

# ```python
# Perform feature processing
# Here we assume that all features are numerical and do not need to be encoded.
# If this is not the case, appropriate feature encoding steps should be added here.
# ```end

# ```python
# Select the appropriate features and target variables for the question
# Here we assume that all features are relevant and the target variable is 'c_24'.
X_train = train_data.drop('c_24', axis=1)
y_train = train_data['c_24']

# ```python
# Perform feature scaling

X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
# ```end

# ```python
# Choose the suitable machine learning algorithm or technique (classifier)
# Here we use Logistic Regression as it is a simple and effective algorithm for binary classification problems.
# It is also easy to interpret and understand, which can be important in many applications.
clf = LogisticRegression(random_state=0)
