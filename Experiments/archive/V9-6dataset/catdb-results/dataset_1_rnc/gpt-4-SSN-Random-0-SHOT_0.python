# ```python
# Import all required packages
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score
# ```end

# ```python
# Load the training and test datasets
train_data = pd.read_csv('../../../data/dataset_1_rnc/dataset_1_rnc_train.csv')
test_data = pd.read_csv('../../../data/dataset_1_rnc/dataset_1_rnc_test.csv')
# ```end

# ```python
# Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
# As per the given schema, there are no missing values and all the columns are of numeric type. So, no data cleaning is required.
# However, we can scale the features to have zero mean and unit variance for better performance of the model.

scaler = StandardScaler()
train_data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(train_data.drop(columns=['c_24']))
test_data_scaled = scaler.transform(test_data.drop(columns=['c_24']))
# ```end

# ```python
# Perform feature processing
# As per the given schema, there are no categorical features. So, no feature processing is required.
# ```end

# ```python
# Select the appropriate features and target variables for the question
# As per the given schema and dataset description, all the columns except 'c_24' are features and 'c_24' is the target variable.

X_train = train_data_scaled
y_train = train_data['c_24']

X_test = test_data_scaled
y_test = test_data['c_24']
# ```end

# ```python
# Perform drops columns
# The column 'c_27' has zero variance as min and max values are the same. So, it can be dropped as it does not contribute to the model.

X_train = pd.DataFrame(X_train).drop(columns=[26])  # 'c_27' is the 27th column, so its index will be 26
X_test = pd.DataFrame(X_test).drop(columns=[26])
# ```end

# ```python
# Choose the suitable machine learning algorithm or technique (classifier)
# Logistic Regression is chosen as the classifier as it is a simple and efficient algorithm for binary classification problems.
# It also works well with scaled features and does not require high computational resources like some other complex models.

clf = LogisticRegression(random_state=0)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
# ```end

# ```python
# Report evaluation based on only test dataset
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the model accuracy
Accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Calculate the model f1 score
F1_score = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Print the accuracy result
print(f"Accuracy: {Accuracy}")

# Print the f1 score result
print(f"F1_score: {F1_score}")
# ```end
