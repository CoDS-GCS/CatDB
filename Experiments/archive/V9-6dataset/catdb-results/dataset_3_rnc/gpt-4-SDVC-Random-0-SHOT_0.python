# ```python
# Import all required packages
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score
# ```end

# ```python
# Load the training and test datasets
train_data = pd.read_csv('../../../data/dataset_3_rnc/dataset_3_rnc_train.csv')

# Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
# In this case, we assume that the data is already clean and does not contain any missing or incorrect values.
# If this is not the case, appropriate data cleaning steps should be added here.
# ```end

# ```python
# Perform feature processing
# In this case, we assume that all features are numerical and do not need to be encoded.
# If this is not the case, appropriate feature encoding steps should be added here.
# ```end

# ```python
# Select the appropriate features and target variables for the question
# In this case, we assume that all columns except 'c_1' are features and 'c_1' is the target variable.
X_train = train_data.drop(columns=['c_1'])
y_train = train_data['c_1']
X_test = test_data.drop(columns=['c_1'])

# ```python
# Perform feature scaling

X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
# ```end

# ```python
# Choose the suitable machine learning algorithm or technique (classifier)
# In this case, we use Logistic Regression as it is a simple and effective algorithm for binary classification problems.
# It is also suitable for multi-threaded environments and can be used with various CPU configurations.
