# ```python
# Import all required packages
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score
# ```end

# ```python
# Load the training and test datasets
train_data = pd.read_csv('../../../data/dataset_4_rnc/dataset_4_rnc_train.csv')
test_data = pd.read_csv('../../../data/dataset_4_rnc/dataset_4_rnc_test.csv')

# ```python
# Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
# In this case, we assume that the data is already clean and does not contain any missing or incorrect values.
# If this is not the case, appropriate data cleaning steps should be added here.
# ```end

# ```python
# Perform feature processing
# In this case, all features are numerical, so no encoding is necessary.
# If there were categorical features, they should be encoded here.
# ```end

# ```python
# Select the appropriate features and target variables for the question
# In this case, we assume that all features are relevant for predicting 'c_61'.
# If this is not the case, irrelevant features should be dropped here.
X_train = train_data.drop('c_61', axis=1)
y_train = train_data['c_61']
X_test = test_data.drop('c_61', axis=1)
y_test = test_data['c_61']
# ```end

# ```python
# Scale the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
# ```end

# ```python
# Choose the suitable machine learning algorithm or technique (classifier)
# In this case, we use Logistic Regression as it is a simple and effective algorithm for binary classification problems.
# It is also suitable for multi-threaded environments and can be used with various CPU configurations.
clf = LogisticRegression(random_state=0)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
# ```end

# ```python
# Report evaluation based on only test dataset
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
