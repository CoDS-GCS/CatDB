# Import all required packages
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score
# ```end

# ```python
# Load the training and test datasets
train_data = pd.read_csv('../../../data/dataset_4_rnc/dataset_4_rnc_train.csv')

# ```python
# Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
# As per the schema, there are no categorical variables. So, no need to handle missing values or outliers.
# All the columns are already in numeric format. So, no need to convert any columns.
# ```end

# ```python
# Perform feature processing
# As per the schema, there are no categorical variables. So, no need to encode any columns.
# ```end

# ```python
# Select the appropriate features and target variables
# As per the schema, 'c_61' is the target variable and all other columns are features.
features = train_data.drop('c_61', axis=1)
target = train_data['c_61']
# ```end

# ```python
# Perform drops columns
# As per the schema, all the columns are distinct and have different ranges. So, no need to drop any columns.
# ```end

# ```python
# Preprocessing based on union of train and test dataset
# As per the schema, all the columns are already in numeric format. So, no need to do any preprocessing.
# ```end

# ```python
# Scale the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
features = scaler.fit_transform(features)
# ```end

# ```python
# Choose the suitable machine learning algorithm or technique (classifier)
# Logistic Regression is chosen because it is a simple and efficient algorithm for binary classification problems.
# It is also easy to interpret and understand.
clf = LogisticRegression()
clf.fit(features, target)
# ```end

# ```python
# Report evaluation based on only test dataset
test_features = test_data.drop('c_61', axis=1)
test_target = test_data['c_61']

# Scale the test features
test_features = scaler.transform(test_features)

# Predict the target values
pred_target = clf.predict(test_features)

# Calculate the model accuracy
Accuracy = accuracy_score(test_target, pred_target)

# Calculate the model f1 score
