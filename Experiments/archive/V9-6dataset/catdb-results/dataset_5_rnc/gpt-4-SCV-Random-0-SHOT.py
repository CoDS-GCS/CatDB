# Load the training and test datasets

# Perform feature processing
# Encode categorical values by dummyEncode

# ```python
# Perform drops columns, if these may be redundant and hurt the predictive performance of the downstream classifier
# Explanation: Dropping columns may help as the chance of overfitting is lower, especially if the dataset is small.
# Here we are not dropping any columns as all the columns seem to be important for predicting 'c_9'
# ```end

# ```python
# In order to avoid runtime error for unseen value on the target feature, do preprocessing based on union of train and test dataset
# Here we are not doing any additional preprocessing as we have already encoded the categorical variables and filled the null values
# ```end

# ```python
# Choose the suitable machine learning algorithm or technique (classifier)
# Explanation: Logistic Regression is a simple and fast algorithm suitable for binary classification problems. It is chosen because it is easy to interpret and does not require any tuning.
# We are not using Random forest Classification algorithm as per the requirement.
