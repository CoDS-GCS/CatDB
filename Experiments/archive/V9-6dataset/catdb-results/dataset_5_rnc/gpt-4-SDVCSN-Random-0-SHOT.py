# As per the given schema, there are no categorical variables. So, we don't need to perform any encoding.
# Also, there is no mention of missing values. So, we assume that there are no missing values in the dataset.
# ```end

# ```python
# Perform feature processing
# As per the given schema, all the features are numerical. So, we don't need to perform any encoding.
# But, the range of values of different features varies a lot. So, we need to perform feature scaling.
