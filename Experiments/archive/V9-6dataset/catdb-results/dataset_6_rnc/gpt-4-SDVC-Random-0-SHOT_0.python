# Import all required packages

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score
# ```end

# ```python
# Load the training and test datasets

# Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
# In this case, we assume that the data is already clean and does not contain any missing or incorrect values.
# If this is not the case, appropriate data cleaning steps should be added here.

# ```python
# Perform feature processing
# In this case, all features are numerical, so we don't need to encode categorical values.
# However, we will standardize the features to have zero mean and unit variance.

# Select the appropriate features and target variables for the question
# In this case, we assume that all features are relevant and the target variable is 'c_11'.

y_train = train_data['c_11']

# Perform drops columns, if these may be redundant and hurt the predictive performance of the downstream classifier
# In this case, we assume that all features are relevant and do not drop any columns.
# If this is not the case, appropriate feature selection steps should be added here.

# ```python
# Choose the suitable machine learning algorithm or technique (classifier)
# In this case, we use Logistic Regression as it is a simple and effective algorithm for binary classification problems.
# It is also suitable for multi-threaded environments and can be easily parallelized across multiple CPUs.
