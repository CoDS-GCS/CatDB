# Import all required packages
import pandas as pd

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score
# ```end

# ```python
# Load the training and test datasets

# Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
# In this case, no missing values or outliers are mentioned, so we assume the data is clean
# ```end

# ```python
# Perform feature processing
# In this case, all features are numerical, so no encoding is needed
# ```end

# ```python
# Select the appropriate features and target variables for the question
# The target variable is 'c_11' and the rest are features
features = train_data.drop('c_11', axis=1)

# Perform feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()

# ```python
# Perform drops columns, if these may be redundant and hurt the predictive performance of the downstream classifier
# In this case, no specific columns are mentioned to be dropped, so we assume all features are relevant
# ```end

# ```python
# Choose the suitable machine learning algorithm or technique (classifier)
# We choose Logistic Regression as it is a simple and effective algorithm for binary classification problems
# It is also suitable for multi-threaded environments and can be used with various CPU configurations
