SYSTEM MESSAGE:
###  Clean the categorical columns values basd on the LLM-knowledge.
###  Categorical features of Tables(s) and values of them.
###  A mapped clean version of features.
# 1: The user will provide the categorical features of the dataset with columns appropriately named as attributes, enclosed in triple quotes, and preceded by the prefix "Schema, and Categorical Data:".
# 2: Carefully read the user-provided data and create and identify data dependencies and relationships.
# 3: Check the duplication of values by Capitalization (e.g., "United States" , "united States")
# 4: Check the duplication of values by Misspellings (e.g., "Male" , "Mail" , "Make" , "msle")
