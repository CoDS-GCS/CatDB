# Usefulness: This feature combines the 'Sex' and 'Shucked' attributes. It may provide additional information about the relationship between the sex of the abalone and the weight of meat.

# Usefulness: This feature combines the 'Shell' and 'Diameter' attributes. It may provide additional information about the relationship between the shell weight and the diameter of the abalone.

# ```python-dropping-columns
# Explanation why the column 'Whole' is dropped
# The 'Whole' column represents the whole weight of abalone. This information is already represented by other features such as 'Shucked', 'Shell', and 'Viscera'. Therefore, it may be redundant and can be dropped to avoid overfitting.

# Use a RandomForestClassifier technique
# Explanation why the solution is selected: RandomForestClassifier is a versatile machine learning method capable of performing both regression and classification tasks. It also handles higher dimensionality data very well, making it suitable for this dataset.

# ```end

# ```python
# Report evaluation based on only test dataset
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the model accuracy
Accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
