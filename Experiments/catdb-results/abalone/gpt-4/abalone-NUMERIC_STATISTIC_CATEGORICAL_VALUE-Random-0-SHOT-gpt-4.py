# (Feature name and description) 
# Usefulness: (Description why this adds useful real world knowledge to classify 'Rings' according to dataset description and attributes.) 
# Add a new column for each row in df

# Feature: 'Volume'
# Usefulness: Volume is a combination of Length, Diameter and Height which might be a better predictor for 'Rings' as it represents the overall size of the abalone.

# ```python-dropping-columns
# Explanation why the column XX is dropped
# 'Length', 'Diameter' and 'Height' are dropped as they are now represented by the 'Volume' feature

# ```python 
# Use a RandomForestClassifier technique
# Explanation why the solution is selected: RandomForestClassifier is a robust and versatile classifier that can handle both categorical and numerical features. It also has the advantage of being able to handle missing values and outliers.

# Define the target variable and the feature variables
y_train = train_data['Rings']
X_train = train_data.drop('Rings', axis=1)

y_test = test_data['Rings']
X_test = test_data.drop('Rings', axis=1)

# Initialize the RandomForestClassifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
# ```end

# ```python
# Report evaluation based on only test dataset
# Calculate the model accuracy, represented by a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates low accuracy and 1 signifies higher accuracy. Store the accuracy value in a variable labeled as "Accuracy=...".
# Calculate the model f1 score, represented by a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates low accuracy and 1 signifies higher accuracy. Store the f1 score value in a variable labeled as "F1_score=...".
# Print the accuracy result: print(f"Accuracy:{Accuracy}")   
# Print the f1 score result: print(f"F1_score:{F1_score}") 

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy and f1 score
Accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
F1_score = f1_score(y_test, y_pred, average='weighted')

# Print the results
print(f"Accuracy: {Accuracy}")
print(f"F1_score: {F1_score}")
