train_data['V16_V44_ratio'] = train_data['V16'] / train_data['V44']

# ```python-dropping-columns
# Explanation why the column V22 is dropped: V22 has a very small range of values (1.0, 3.0) and its mean and median are very close to the maximum value. This indicates that the column might not have much variance and hence, might not be very useful for the classification task.

# Use a RandomForestClassifier technique
# Explanation why the solution is selected: RandomForestClassifier is a robust and versatile classifier that works well even without much hyperparameter tuning. It also handles feature interactions well, which might be useful given the new feature we created.
