This pipeline first imputes missing values with the median of the respective column, then scales the features to have zero mean and unit variance, and finally fits a random forest classifier on the training data. The random forest classifier is a good choice for this task because it can handle both categorical and numerical features, it does not require feature scaling, and it can capture complex non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable. The pipeline is then used to predict the target variable on the test data, and the accuracy and F1 score of the predictions are reported.
