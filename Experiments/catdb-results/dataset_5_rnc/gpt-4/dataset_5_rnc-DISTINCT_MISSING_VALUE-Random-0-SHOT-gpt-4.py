# Usefulness: This feature captures the interaction between 'c_1' and 'c_9'. 
# This could be useful if the effect of 'c_1' on the target variable 'c_9' is not constant but depends on the value of 'c_9'.

# ```python-dropping-columns
# Explanation why the column c_1 is dropped: 
# 'c_1' has a very low distinct count (3), which means it has very low variance. 
# Low variance features often don't contain much information for prediction, so we drop it.

# Use a RandomForestClassifier technique
# Explanation why the solution is selected: RandomForestClassifier is a robust and versatile classifier that can handle both numerical and categorical features. 
# It also has built-in feature importance estimation, which can be useful for feature selection.
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42, n_jobs=-1)

# Separate features and target variable
X_train = train_data.drop(columns=['c_9'])

# Train the model
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# ```python
# Report evaluation based on only test dataset
# Calculate the model accuracy, represented by a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates low accuracy and 1 signifies higher accuracy. Store the accuracy value in a variable labeled as "Accuracy=...".
# Calculate the model f1 score, represented by a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates low accuracy and 1 signifies higher accuracy. Store the f1 score value in a variable labeled as "F1_score=...".
