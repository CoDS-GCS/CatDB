# Feature name and description: c_1_c_4_ratio
# Usefulness: This feature represents the ratio of c_1 to c_4. This could be useful if there is a meaningful relationship between these two features that could help predict 'c_9'.
train_data['c_1_c_4_ratio'] = train_data['c_1'] / train_data['c_4']

# Use a RandomForestClassifier technique
# Explanation why the solution is selected: RandomForestClassifier is a robust and versatile classifier that can handle both categorical and numerical features. It also has features to handle overfitting.

y_train = train_data['c_9']

clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
# ```end

# ```python
# Report evaluation based on only test dataset
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the model accuracy
Accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Calculate the model f1 score
F1_score = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Print the accuracy result
