# (Some pandas code using 'S3', 'S4', ... to add a new column for each row in df)

# Here we are creating a new feature 'total' which is the sum of all the 'S' features. 
# This could be useful as it might capture some information about the overall 'strength' of the hand.

# Explanation why the column XX is dropped
# Here we are dropping the 'C' features as they might be redundant and could lead to overfitting.
# The 'C' features represent the 'suit' of the card, which is not important in determining the 'CLASS' of the hand in poker.

# Use a RandomForestClassifier technique
# Explanation why the solution is selected: RandomForestClassifier is a powerful and flexible model that can capture complex patterns in the data. It also has the advantage of being able to handle both categorical and numerical features.

y_train = train_data['CLASS']
X_test = test_data.drop('CLASS', axis=1)

# ```python

# Print the accuracy result: print(f"Accuracy:{Accuracy}")
