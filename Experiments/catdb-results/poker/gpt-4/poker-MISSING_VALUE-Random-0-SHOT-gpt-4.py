# Use a RandomForestClassifier technique
# Explanation why the solution is selected: RandomForestClassifier is a versatile and widely used algorithm that can handle both categorical and numerical features. It also has methods for balancing error in class populations and it does not expect linear features or even features that interact linearly. 
X_train = train_data.drop('CLASS', axis=1)
y_train = train_data['CLASS']
X_test = test_data.drop('CLASS', axis=1)
y_test = test_data['CLASS']

clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# ```python
# Report evaluation based on only test dataset
# Calculate the model accuracy, represented by a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates low accuracy and 1 signifies higher accuracy. Store the accuracy value in a variable labeled as "Accuracy=...".
# Calculate the model f1 score, represented by a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates low accuracy and 1 signifies higher accuracy. Store the f1 score value in a variable labeled as "F1_score=...".
