# Use a RandomForestClassifier technique
# RandomForestClassifier is a robust and versatile classifier that works well on a large range of datasets. It can handle binary and multiclass classification problems. It also has features to handle overfitting.

# Define the features and target
features = ['S1', 'S2', 'S3', 'S4', 'S5', 'C1', 'C2', 'C3', 'C4', 'C5', 'S_sum', 'C_sum']
target = 'CLASS'

# Define the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42, n_jobs=-1)

# Train the model
model.fit(train_data[features], train_data[target])
# ```end

# ```python
# Report evaluation based on only test dataset
# Calculate the model accuracy
predictions = model.predict(test_data[features])
Accuracy = accuracy_score(test_data[target], predictions)

# Calculate the model f1 score
F1_score = f1_score(test_data[target], predictions, average='weighted')

# Print the accuracy result
print(f"Accuracy:{Accuracy}")

# Print the f1 score result
print(f"F1_score:{F1_score}")
# ```end
