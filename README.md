# CatDB: Data-catalog-guided, LLM-based Generation of Data-centric ML Pipelines

![Overview](images/workflow.png)

**Overview:** CatDB a comprehensive, LLM-guided generator of data-centric ML pipelines that utilizes available data catalog information. We incorporate data profiling information and user descriptions into a chain of LLM prompts for data cleaning/augmentation, feature engineering, and model selection. Additionally, we devise a robust framework for managing the LLM interactions and handling errors through pipeline modifications and a knowledge base of error scenarios.
