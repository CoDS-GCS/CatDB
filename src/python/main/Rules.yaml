  task: 'Task: Generate a data science pipeline in Python 3.10 that answers a question based on a given dataset, {}.'
  input: 'Input: A dataset in CSV format, a schema that describes the columns and data types of the dataset, and a data profiling info that summarizes the statistics and quality of the dataset. A question that requires data analysis or modeling to answer.'
  output: 'Output: A Python 3.10 code that performs the following steps:'
  Rule_1: 'Import the necessary libraries and modules.'
  Rule_2: 'Load the training and test datasets. For the training data, utilize the variable """train_data={}""", and for the test data, employ the variable """test_data={}""". Utilize pandas CSV readers to load the datasets.'
  Rule_3: 'Do not split the train_data into train and test sets. Use only the given datasets.'
  Rule_4: 'The user will provide the {} of the dataset with columns appropriately named as attributes, enclosed in triple quotes, and preceded by the prefix "{}".'
  Rule_5: 'Explicitly analyze feature based on the provided data profiling information and implement data preprocessing tasks: i) handel missing values, ii) select appropriate data transfer for each column specifically (categorical values and numerical values based on min, max, mean, median values), iii) apply data cleaning based on data profiling information.'
  Rule_6: 'Explicitly implement Outlier removal for Train and Test data based on the provided data profiling information.'
  Rule_7: 'Explicitly do data augmentation techniques based on the data profiling information (use your knowledge to chose best technique).'
  Rule_8: 'Explicitly analyze feature based on the provided data profiling information and implement feature engineering task.'
  Rule_9: 'Explicitly select a best model based on the data profiling information.'
  Rule_10: 'Select the appropriate features and target variables for the question. Additional columns add new semantic information, additional columns that are useful for a downstream algorithm predicting "{}". They can e.g. be feature combinations, transformations, aggregations where the new column is a function of the existing columns. Use appropriate scale factor for columns are need to transfer.'
  Rule_11: 'Perform drops columns, if these may be redundant and hurt the predictive performance of the downstream {} (Feature selection). Dropping columns may help as the chance of overfitting is lower, especially if the dataset is small. The {} will be trained on the dataset with the generated columns and evaluated on a holdout set.'
  Rule_12: 'In order to avoid runtime error for unseen value on the target feature, do preprocessing based on union of train and test dataset.'
  Rule_13: 'If the question is not relevant to the dataset or the task, the output should be: "Insufficient information."'
  Rule_14: 'Do not report validation evaluation. We do not need it.'
