  task: 'Predict missing values based on the user-provided dataset and LLM knowledge.'
  input: 'A tabular dataset with comma separators, where the first row is the header of the dataset.'
  output: 'A scalar value or values for missing items.'
  Rule_1: 'The user will provide the {} of the dataset with columns appropriately named as attributes, enclosed in triple quotes, and preceded by the prefix "{}".'
  Rule_2: 'Carefully read the user-provided data and create and identify data dependencies and relationships.'
  Rule_3: 'Carefully predict the items requested by the user and return them.'
  Rule_4: 'If you predict a value, report it based on this template: for example, if the user asks to predict the value for column "c_1" and "c_2", your response should be "### Row <INDEX>: c_1=<PREDICT_VALUE>, c_2=<PREDICT_VALUE>". For the next rows follow the same format.'
  Rule_5: 'Do not return extra messages or explanations.'
